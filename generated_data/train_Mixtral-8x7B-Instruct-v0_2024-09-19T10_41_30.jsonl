A missing package, on the other hand, is a package that is required for the build but is not available in the Linux distribution or in the package repository. In RPM build failures, a typo is usually easier to fix than a missing package, as it only requires correcting the spelling or formatting error. A missing package, on the other hand, may require adding the package to the Linux distribution or changing the package dependencies."}
