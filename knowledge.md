# Resolving RPM build problems

LogDetective helps you understand why your RPM build failed using the build
log. It analyzes logs using a Large Language Model (LLM) and Drain template
miner. Based on your input log, LogDetective will explain why the build failed
and will suggest a solution.

LogDetective team is building a data set with annotated logs of failures that
will help us produce high quality suggestions that target Fedora, CentOS Stream
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystems.
