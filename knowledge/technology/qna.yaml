      Error while starting the test suite. Python couldn't import the click module.
    "question": |-
      Explain log snippets from an RPM build.
  - "answer": |-
      To add a missing dependency for a package, directive Requires or BuildRequires can be used. Since this
      dependency is only required by the test suite, BuildRequires is the right choice because it installs the
      dependency only on the build machine, not when the package is installed by the user. Add spec directive
      BuildRequires into the spec file preamble with a package name that provides the Python package click. In Fedora,
      this would be `BuildRequires: python-click`.
    "question": |-
      How can I resolve the issue?

      The build failed at the check stage while running the test suite for the package. The test suite requires the

    ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhos
  "questions_and_answers":
  - "answer": |-
      This error message indicates that the user "root" attempting to connect to the MySQL server from the local host
      (localhost) is not authorized to perform the requested actions. The specific action that failed was attempting
      to alter the password for the "root" user and create a new database named "test_db".
    "question": |-
      Explain log snippets from an RPM build.
  - "answer": |-
      To resolve this error, you will need to verify that the password for the "root" user is correct. You can do this
      by running the following command:  mysql -u root -p  This will prompt you to enter the password for the "root"
      user. If the password is incorrect, you will be denied access to the database. If the password is correct, you
      will be presented with the MySQL command prompt.  Once you have verified that the password is correct, you can
      retry the original command to alter the password for the "root" user and create the new database.  Here is the
      complete command again:  mysql -u root -S /builddir/build/BUILD/aws-xray-sdk-python-2.12.1/mysql.sock -P 13573
      -e 'ALTER USER ''root''@''localhost'' IDENTIFIED BY '''root'';

      This is not an easy issue to resolve. There are multiple possible root causes here. You should retry the build

    "question": |-
      How can I resolve the issue?

      Fedora always provides a single version of each package.  You typically want to a) start providing a different
      `python3dist(botocore) to meet the dependancy b) start depending on a different version 3) provide a compat
      package so both versions are available in fedora You want to go with 1) and 2) because 3) is very ineconomical.

      helper function that is supposed to mark those tests as skipped rather than failed no longer works. To fix the
